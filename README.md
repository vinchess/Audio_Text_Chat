# Audio_Text_Chat
Class assignment : Implementing a multi chat system of multiple users to one admin. Requirement is to achieve multiple connections to admin and establish unique chat system with no cross over. Additional requirement includes button to record audio to be sent over as a file. Extra : I altered the audio requirement to send live stream of audio via UDP connection instead.
